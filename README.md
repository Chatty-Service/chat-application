# Chatty Chat Application

- Chatty is a full stack chat application.


# Overview:

- Chatty was developed using the MERN stack, React was chosen to be used for frontend for updating the virtual dom and enhancing the UX of the client. Mongodb was used as a database to provide a cost effective NO-SQL database. Node.js was used for the server, since it provides run-time environment for javascript, to create the server, additionally Express.js was used as a layer built on the top of the Node js that helps manage servers and routes

- There are features that are to be added on chatty in the future such as voice and  video call features and many more!

# Installation:
- Using and installing chatty is quite simple, all that is required is to install all the dependencies (via NPM) of the server and client folders.(each folder has a separate package.json).
